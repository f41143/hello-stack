# hello-stack
Genesis repository for HMCW version control, sub-project of the IoT stack
My plan is to iterate on the possibility of using GitHUb to control approved versions of critical programs, until a proof-of-concept is completed.
Follow the below steps until we reach a point that needs clear development to move forward. We'll capture this draft work instruction below.
 - Sign up to GitHub with HMC employee number (i.e. mine is f41143), and a privately held password
 - Search for the 'hello-stack' repository
 - Branch off the 'main' repository, name the branch in reference to your inital branching
 - Add edits to this README.md file, and 'Commit' those changes
 - ?
