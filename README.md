# hello-stack
Genesis repository for HMCW version control, sub-project of the IoT stack.
My plan is to iterate on the possibility of using GitHUb to control approved versions of critical programs, until a proof-of-concept is completed.
Follow the below steps until we reach a point that needs clear development to move forward. We'll capture this as a draft work instruction below.
 - Sign up to GitHub with HMC employee number (i.e. mine is f41143), and a privately held password
 - Search for the 'hello-stack' repository
 - Branch off the 'main' repository, name the branch in reference to your inital branching, or date (format: DAYmonthYEAR)
 - Add edits to this README.md file, and 'Commit' those changes
 - 'Pull Request'and allow the owner (f41143) to comment, verify process above
 - Continue with the procedure above until working memebers are satisfied with draft WI
 - 'Commit' a winder/welder program (wwp); to be 'Merged' with 'hello_stack'
 - Trial the use of wwp as a branch, named with date
 - Make changes to branched program, 'Commit' and 'Pull Request' to view changes
 - (Will have to determine how to handle changed programs, i.e. how do we implement good changes? how do we investigate bad changes?)
 - ?
